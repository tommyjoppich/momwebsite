    <p>Hello and welcome to the mom website where we collect and display all the most recent news about our beloved mother! Please feel free to browse our multiple sections where you can learn more! There's lots to uncover. And remember, we are mom's number one fans!</p>

    <h2 id = "pricing">Biography</h2>
    <p>Mom was born on March 7, 1973, twenty-nine years ago. As the thirteenth of fourteen children, Mom had no shrotage of friends at home. Growing up in Warren, MI, was an adventure every day, but Mom wouldn't have had it any other way. After finishing school, Mom began work at a law firm as an administrative assistant. This is how she met Dad. Shortly after marriage, Mom found out that she was pregnant with her first son who would later come to be known as Joey. Mom was now officially a Mom. Two years later, a second son came along: Tommy. With her family now complete, Mom settled into life in their Lake Orion, MI, home. After raising both of her boys for 20 years, Mom welcomed a new child into the home, a mini golden doodle named Chloe. As Joey and Tommy move off to school, Chloe now keeps Mom company at their home in Lake Orion as Mom adjusts to the empty nest lifestyle yet continues to be a strong and loving mother.</p>

          <p>Birth of a Mother/Family Mom: <br>
              Mom began her career as an awesome Mom with the birth of her first child, Joey. In the first image of baptism, Mom was fulfilling a dream and beginning a lifelong journey of fulfillment and love as she fulfilled one of her first motherly duties. Continuing along, we see Mom is truly a great American mom. Her family unit is the most important thing to her, and she gives and recieves so much love. It is truly amazing to see.</p>

          <p>Mom the Adventurer and Cultural Icon: <br>
              Although she may sometimes need a little extra prodding, Mom has an adventurous side that comes out whenever we are on an excursion. From zip linnig to cave snorkeling, Mom has an ability to make any already crazy adventure even more fun. Just as much, Mom is always one to stay "hip and with it". Mom sometimes reluctantly takes on the role of "cool mom" for her boys. Integrating slang into her vocabulary is one of her favorite pastimes, ensuring she will never fall behind the times.</p>
